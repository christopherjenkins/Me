# Engineering Operational Maturity Matrix

## Process

### Product/Project
* Are there dedicated product/solution owners?
* Are product owners attached to specific teams or are they a functional team?
* Does product regularly engage in gathering user feedback?
* Do teams hold regular daily meetings?
* Do teams work in sprints and observe typical sprint ceremonies (planning, demo/retro)
* Do team members commit to reasonable amounts of work, or are they pressured to overcommit? 
* Who sets due dates?
* Is velocity consistent?
* Are there dedicated Project Managers?
### QA/Test/UAT
* Is there dedicated QA in a reasonable ratio of eng to qa? (1:5 min) 
* Is QA attached to a scrum team or are they a functional separate team?
* Does QA do test automation? Manual Regressions? Combination of both?
* Do engineers write unit tests? What is overall test coverage?
* Load/Stress Testing on API and bottlenecks?
* Do engineers consider testing a core part of their job?
* Do we conduct User Acceptance Testing? What is the process & who participates?
### Engineering
* Do engineers have everything they need to complete a unit of work before beginning?
* Are engineers encouraged to collaborate?
* Are there regular pair programming sessions?
* Do engineers conduct thorough peer code reviews?
* Are engineers committed to the organizational process?
* Do engineers have the ability to push back on product reqs or imposed deadlines?
* Are engineers given enough whitespace to work out difficult problems and engage in continued learning?
### DevOps
* What does the gitflow look like?
* Are there automated build & release pipelines for all environments?
* Disaster Recovery & Backups for DB State?
* Are there proper permissions setup for production environments?
* Are all builds also tested?
* How long would it take you to recover from a cloud provider critical outage requiring you to move everything?
* Have we identified areas of vendor lock-in? (not bad, but should know)
* Secret/Key security policies in place?
* APM, Infrastructure monitoring, on-call hours?
### CX
* Do we have dedicated sales engineers / subject matter experts of our products?
* Do we have dedicated, tiered support mechanisms?
* Is there an onboarding team?
* Do we have customer facing documentation? (if required)
### Executive Support
* Do executives support engineering initiatives? 
* What is the role of engineering in the organization?
* Is engineering viewed as a critical component or a necessary evil?
* Do executives override product goals or engineering timelines regularly?
* Is there a defined budget for engineering initiatives?
* Do we understand how engineering contributes to company revenue results?
* Does engineering have executive representation on par with others in the organization?
