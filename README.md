# Welcome!
I've been building things for as long as I've been able to hold legos, and I've been working and playing with computers for as long as I can remember. I love empowering individuals and teams to build things that I could only dream about doing alone. Working together affords us an opportunity to create something substantially greater than _just_ the sum of its parts. 

I try to do/be everything on this document when I'm at work. I fail as often as I succeed, but it's my aim to be better every day. 

## People
Ultimately, I care **most** about the people on my teams. Every individual on a great team is on a different journey, has different goals, and priorities. I believe in helping align those individual goals with the goals of the organization and I want to ensure everyone is getting a return on their investment into a product. To make sure this is happening I constantly:

* facilitate communication
* provide motivation 
* help unblock 
* advocate for individuals in the broader organization 
* develop and empower other leaders
* reward and recognize success
* resolve conflict and provide correction (the hardest thing for me to do)
* help people laugh and enjoy their time at work

## Process
After that, my priority is finding a cadence, a set of tools, and a set of methods for a particular group of people that suits their needs best. The only requirement is that our methods allow for frequent iteration, frequent user feedback, and prioritize collaboration over blame. 

The people who use what we build (end users) are the reason we're coming into work every day. They either currently pay our bills, or we're counting on them to pay them in the future. Every member on the team should have a good idea of who our users are, and they should do *everything* with them in mind. 

Some organizations keep engineers and technical product management away from the users, relying instead on business analysts or business minded product owners.

## Outcome
I believe if you have the right people, and develop and enforce strict process, desirable business outcomes happen naturally. My responsibility to an organization is to communicate "when will you be done", and "how much is it going to cost". Organizations that place heavy emphasis on their technology departments are easier to work with in this regard, but constant communication is key. 

## Bikeshedding
I care least about what cloud provider we select, where code is hosted, arguments about which language/framework to use in a greenfield project. That's not to say they aren't critical decisions (they are), but it's more important to move past these decision points quickly to move into delivery.
