# Welcome

It's good to meet you, I'm glad you're here! We're going to build amazing things together, and I believe we're going to have fun while we do it.

I've been building things for as long as I've been able to hold legos, and I've been working and playing with computers for as long as I can remember. I love empowering individuals and teams to build things that I could only dream about doing alone. Working together affords us an opportunity to create something substantially greater than _just_ the sum of its parts.

I try to do/be everything on this document when I'm at work. I fail as often as I succeed, but it's my aim to be better every day.

## What to expect from me

### Availability

Nothing is more important than talking to **you** if you need to talk. Feel free to book time on my calendar, grab me in the hallway, nudge me when I have my headphones on.

For less urgent needs, slack is the best way to ask me non-blocking questions, talk about that rumor you heard, ask clarifying questions, etc.

### Trust

I'm going to trust that you're better at your job than I am at your job. I trust you to make good decisions and act professionally. I trust that you'll tell me if you're struggling. If I let you down and don't notice, let me know so I can fix it! You should feel safe approaching me and debating me.

### Meetings

You'll join us in weekly staff meetings with your peers. These are not for status updates (we have backlogs and boards for that). We'll focus primarily on a weekly shared agenda document, discuss risks to longer term goals, and ensure we are aligned across all of our engineering teams. Part of this is to have some time to stretch our minds and discuss other issues we are facing.

Additionally, we will have regular 1:1's ( at least monthly ). The goal of 1:1's are similar to the above, but allow for an environment where you and I can be comfortable and feel secure in sharing with each other.

### Feedback & OKR's

We'll use the formal review processes of {company} to manage your OKR's.

Expect feedback from me when I have it. Unless the issue is serious, I won't schedule a meeting specifically to give you feedback.

Feedback goes both ways. Expect me to ask regularly in our 1:1's how I can be doing better. You should feel confident in being honest with me. All feedback is valid.

Tell me when I screw up, disagree with me. We'll both be better for it.

## What I care about

### People

Ultimately, I care **most** about the people on my teams. Every individual on a great team is on a different journey, has different goals, and priorities. I believe in helping align those individual goals with the goals of the organization and I want to ensure everyone is getting a return on their investment into a product. To make sure this is happening I constantly:

* facilitate communication
* provide motivation
* help unblock
* advocate for individuals in the broader organization 
* develop and empower other leaders
* reward and recognize success
* resolve conflict and provide correction (the hardest thing for me to do)
* help people laugh and enjoy their time at work

### Process

After that, my priority is finding a cadence, a set of tools, and a set of methods for a particular group of people that suits their needs best. The only requirement is that our methods allow for frequent iteration, frequent user feedback, and prioritize collaboration over blame.

The people who use what we build (end users) are the reason we're coming into work every day. They either currently pay our bills, or we're counting on them to pay them in the future. Every member on the team should have a good idea of who our users are, and they should do *everything* with them in mind.

Some organizations keep engineers and technical product management away from the users, relying instead on business analysts or business minded product owners.

### Outcome

I believe if you have the right people, and develop and enforce strict process, desirable business outcomes happen naturally. My responsibility to an organization is to communicate "when will you be done", and "how much is it going to cost". Organizations that place heavy emphasis on their technology departments are easier to work with in this regard, but constant communication is key.

### Bikeshedding

I care least about what cloud provider we select, where code is hosted, arguments about which language/framework to use in a greenfield project. That's not to say they aren't critical decisions (they are), but it's more important to move past these decision points quickly to move into delivery.

## Shortcomings

* I have trouble being told to do something. If you need something, it's best to just ask me for a favor, I respond much more *favorably*.
* I have a really short attention span. My favorite part of any project is the beginning.
* Sometimes it takes more effort to *really* get my attention. If I'm staring at you with a blank face and open mouth, I'm probably thinking about something else. Feel free to snap me out of it.

## TODO

* Complete Readme.md
* Article Ideas
  * Running Successful meetings
  * How I measure performance
  * How to give me feedback
  * My personal hiring matrix
  * Quarterly OKR's, Professional Goals, & Reviews
  * Weekly Staff Meetings
